# Some go practice stuff

- redo the reverse
- make reverse for doubly linked list as well


## things to remember
- arrays values are next to each other in memory, so fast to access. Size is fixed.
- linked list use extra memory to store pointers, doubly use double the memory. However, size is dynamic.
